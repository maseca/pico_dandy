# pico_dandy
This project was suggested by my dad as a way to get comfortable writing games for the Pico-8 Fantasy Console, which runs mainly Lua code.
Pico cartridge files contain all of the Lua source, sprite and sound effect data for the virtual machine to interpret, making them easy for the community to share and hack.

Dandy, or Dandy Dungeon was originally written for the Atari 8-bit computers, and this project is intended to faithfully port the original functionality and gameplay, to the limitations of the Pico-8 emulated hardware.
